# GitOps Workflow using ArgoCD on Kubernetes

## Overview

This project implements a GitOps workflow using ArgoCD to continuously sync and deploy a Kubernetes application directly from a Git repository.

**Objective**: Automatically deploy and update a sample guestbook app using GitOps principles.

---

## Tools & Technologies

- **Kubernetes (Minikube)**
- **ArgoCD**
- **GitHub**
- **Docker**
- **YAML (K8s manifests)**

---

## Steps Performed

1. **Set up Minikube on Local Machine**
2. **Installed ArgoCD in Kubernetes**
3. **Created a GitHub repo containing app manifest files**
4. **Deployed the guestbook app using ArgoCD Application manifest**
5. **Configured ArgoCD for automated sync (`syncPolicy.automated`)**
6. **Tested the pipeline by changing Docker image version in `deployment.yaml`**
7. **Verified auto-sync and rolling update via ArgoCD UI**
8. **Application running and accessible via port-forwarding**

---

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Git can act as the single source of truth in a CI/CD pipeline using ArgoCD. All Kubernetes deployments are managed declaratively via Git. Any update to the repo is automatically detected and synced by ArgoCD, ensuring fast and reliable deployments.
