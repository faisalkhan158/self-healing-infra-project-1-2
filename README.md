# Self-Healing Infrastructure with Prometheus, Alertmanager & Ansible

## ðŸš€ Overview
A self-healing infrastructure project that detects service failures using Prometheus and Alertmanager and automatically resolves them using Ansible.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
- Prometheus
- Alertmanager
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Ansible
- Flask (Python webhook)
- NGINX

## ðŸ“¦ Features
- Monitors NGINX availability via NGINX Exporter.
- Sends alerts using Alertmanager.
- Executes an Ansible playbook to restart NGINX when it goes down.
- Clean and modular Docker-based setup.

## ðŸš€ How It Works
1. **NGINX container** is deployed and monitored using **NGINX Prometheus Exporter**.
2. **Prometheus** scrapes metrics and triggers an alert when NGINX exporter is down.
3. **Alertmanager** sends this alert to a **custom Flask webhook**.
4. The **webhook** runs an **Ansible playbook** that restarts the NGINX container â€” achieving self-healing.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- `prometheus/` â€” Configs for Prometheus and alert rules
- `alertmanager/` â€” Alertmanager config with webhook
- `webhook/` â€” Python Flask app, Ansible playbook and Dockerfile
- `nginx/` â€” NGINX config
- `docker-compose.yml` â€” Everything bundled here

## âœ… Output
- Alert fired on Prometheus
- Webhook triggered and Ansible playbook executed
- NGINX container automatically restarted
